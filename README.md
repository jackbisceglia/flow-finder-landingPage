# FlowFinder: _Find your Flow_

## We can lay out our necessary data/information here, and then populate the web page with it afterwards

### Mission Statement

### The Difference
The difference between our poduct and other bathroom finding applications on the market is that our product is extremely detail oriented; This means when using our app you can clearly identify what kind of bahtroom/restroom you are potentially walking into. Does it have a shower? Is it special needs friendly? You also can see what other people think of the bathroom experience using our comment reviews and rating feature for each bathroom. This helps especially when dealing with variables outside of a bathrooms perspective. For example, someone in the comments can tell you if the bahtroom is located maybe in a more safe part of the town.

### The Advantage
The advantage of our product is that our application is built on the information that solely provided by our users reviews of bathrooms and actively improves the detail quality of our apps map-bahtroom location in regions where our application is relatively used more actively. This helps us help the user have a better experience using our app. So the more our application is used, the better the quality of the app gets.


### Target Market/Personas
Our target market users are tourists. One of our main goals with our app is to make a tourists experience in an unknown territory alot more seamless and easy to navigate by enabling them to find basic necessities such as hygiene in alot more defined manner; instead of being lost in translation in a new country and being overwhelmed, with just a few clicks on their phone, they now possess sufficient information to navigate themselves to the closest bathroom.

### Business Model (profit/nonprofit)
For non-profit we plan to collaborate with local governments in order to be subsidized and also make sure that our apps is advertised in travel hot spots- such as train stations and airports.

When talking about For-profit we plan to run ads on our application without hurting the user experience. As we build the user base, this becomes a much larger revenue stream, as exhibited by many of todays most popular apps.

We also plan to create an "early-bird" subscription tier to our application; in which users will be the one of the first ones to gain access to features that we may potentially roll out to the free version of the application, based on how the early bird tier users receive the new features.
