# FlowFinder: _Find your Flow_

## We can lay out our necessary data/information here, and then populate the web page with it afterwards

### Mission Statement

### The Difference
The difference between our poduct and other bathroom finding applications on the market is that our product is extremely detail oriented; This means when using our app you can clearly identify what kind of bahtroom/restroom you are potentially walking into. Does it have a shower? Is it special needs friendly? You also can see what other people think of the bathroom experience using our comment reviews and rating feature for each bathroom. This helps especially when dealing with variables outside of a bathrooms perspective. For example, someone in the comments can tell you if the bahtroom is located maybe in a more safe part of the town.

### The Advantage
The advantage of our product is that our application is built on the information that solely provided by our users reviews of bathrooms and actively improves the detail quality of our apps map-bahtroom location in regions where our application is relatively used more actively. This helps us help the user have a better experience using our app. So the more our application is used, the better the quality of the app gets.


### Target Market/Personas
Our target market users are tourists. One of our main goals with our app is to make a tourists experience in an unknown territory alot more seamless and easy to navigate by enabling them to find basic necessities such as hygiene in alot more defined manner; instead of being lost in translation in a new country and being overwhelmed, with just a few clicks on their phone, they now possess sufficient information to navigate themselves to the closest bathroom. However, our total adressabel market in theory would be the entire world population. The only thing that holds this back is by access to the internet and access to travelling to public areas.

### Business Model (profit/nonprofit)
For non-profit we plan to collaborate with local governments in order to be subsidized and also make sure that our apps is advertised in travel hot spots- such as train stations and airports. We also plan to partnet with social NGOs that focus on public hygiene and fixing equality in underdevelop countries.

When talking about For-profit we plan to run ads on our application without hurting the user experience. As we build the user base, this becomes a much larger revenue stream, as exhibited by many of todays most popular apps.

We also plan to create an "early-bird" subscription tier to our application; in which users will be the one of the first ones to gain access to features that we may potentially roll out to the free version of the application, based on how the early bird tier users receive the new features.


### PIT Product Specification
Accessbility: We plan on making sure that anyone from any socioeconomic group has access to our technology and We also want to make sure that our technology is easy usable by anyone. Essentially is this solved by itself as anyone with internet access can use this application. However, we also plan to use implement text to speech and Voice enabled assisstant to the application. We also plan to implement major languages into the app for poeple from any part of then world to be easily use the app without any language barrier.

Target Areas: We want our Flowfinder app to be widely used in places where there is a dire hygiene problem and in places of high concentration of people and we want to make sure that our app acts as a significant reminder to those places on the state of hygiene and basic needs there.  We can make this happen by government endorsed PSA's periodically in those areas about the application. This helps advertise the application to the masses while also helping people improve the local areas hygiene.

End goal: The end goal is the increase the number of public bathrooms per squre kilometer in highly populated and high tourism based areas. We believe that this is the way to make an impact on these places.
